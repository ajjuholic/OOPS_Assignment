        "Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. The goal of encapsulation is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Protection:** Restrict direct access to an object's internal data from outside the class. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Code Organization:** Group releted data and method together, making the code more organize and easier to mantain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Abstraction:** Hide implementation details from the user, allowing them to interact with the object through a well-defined interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Achieving Encapsulation in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python achieves encapsulation through the following mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Private Attributes:** By convention, attributes with names prefixed by a double underscore (__) are treated as private. They are not directly accessible from outside the class but can be accessed within the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Getter and Setter Methods:** To provide controlled access to private attributes, you can define getter and setter methods. Getters retrieve the value of an attribute, and setters modify its value. This allows you to enforce data validation and other logic before accessing or modifying the attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Name Mangling:** Python performs name mangling to make private attributes less easily accessible. When you define an attribute with a double underscore prefix, Python internally renames it to `_ClassName__AttributeName.` This makes it more difficult to access the attribute directly from outside the class, but it's still possible if you know the mangled name."

        "\n",
        "1. **Flexibility and Reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to write more flexible and reusable code. You can write code that operates on a generic object type, and it will work with any object that conforms to that type. This eliminates the need to write separate code for each specific class.\n",

        "2. **Extensibility and Maintainability:**\n",

        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It offers several advantages over other programming approaches, such as procedural programming. Here are some key benefits of using OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity and Reusability:**\n",
        "OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating data and methods within objects. This allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable units. Objects can be reused in different parts of the program or even in other projects, reducing code duplication and improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Encapsulation and Security:**\n",
        "OOP provides mechanisms for data encapsulation, which means that data is hidden within objects and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces (methods). This protects data from accidental or unauthorized modifications, improving code security and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Abstraction and Simplicity:**\n",
        "OOP allows you to create abstractions by hiding complex implementation details behind simple interfaces. This simplifies the understanding and use of objects, as users only need to know how to interact with them through their methods, without worrying about the internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Flexibility and Extensibility:**\n",
        "OOP facilitates flexibility and extensibility by allowing you to easily modify or extend existing code without affecting other parts of the system. You can add new classes or modify existing ones without breaking the overall functionality, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism and Code Reusability:**\n",
        "OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This enables you to write code that can work with objects of various classes without needing to know their specific types, promoting code reusability and reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "7. **Improved Collaboration and Maintainability:**\n",
        "OOP promotes collaboration by allowing developers to work on different parts of a system independently. Objects and classes can be developed and tested separately, making it easier to integrate them later. OOP also improves code maintainability by providing a clear structure and organization, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify code over time."

        "Ans-- In Python, the `__del__` method is a special method (also known as a \"destructor\") that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It is used to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing resources held by the object or closing connections.\n",

        "Ans-- Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through inheritance and duck typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance and Polymorphism**\n",
        "\n",
